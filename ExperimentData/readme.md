In thesis (C-based Implementation of LogCluster, a Data Clustering and Pattern Mining Algorithm for Event Logs), the average values were calculated from five times' experiments (t1-t5).

In short paper (Towards Efficient Event Log Pattern Mining With LogClusterC), the average values were calculated from 10 times' experiments (t1-t10).
