# C-based Implementation of LogCluster Algorithm Experiment Data

This repository supports the R3 principle (Repeatability, Reproducibility, and Rigor) of the experiments in the thesis (https://github.com/zhugehq/thesis-project-logclusterc-experiment-data/blob/master/Thesis/Thesis.pdf).

The thesis manuscript will be continous modified until May 25th, 2016.

To repeat the experiments in the thesis, the experiment folder should contain logcluster.pl, logcluster008.pl, LogClusterC, SLCT, the seven log files (public available whose descriptions are on page 44 of the thesis), and the ExperimentScript itself.
The ExperimentScript is executed with the format shown below. 
*./ExperimentScript experiment_serial_number (e.g. ./ExperimentScript t1)*

The ExperimentScript will cost approximately 75 hours on the computer used in the thesis (Ubuntu Server 14.04. Intel i7-4720 HQ 2.6 GHz CPU, 16 GB DDR3 1600 MHz RAM, WD 1 TB 5400 rpm hard disk.).

The project is stored in another GitHub repository: https://github.com/zhugehq/thesis-project-logclusterc .
